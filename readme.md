<!-- ## More about the project

### Goal

I wanted to create **responsive** one page website with **clear structure** and easly **findable information**.

### Main objectives

- build proper **semantic structure**
- make website **fully responsive**
- use **mobie first** design

### Challenges

The biggest challenge I conquered was to **build a responsive table** presenting the calendar of events for current year. The main problem was to present **dwo dimensional data** on narrow **mobile screen**.

In the table each record contains all the details about an event - name, date, location, organiser and so on. In mobile version I decided to group all the details of each event and present them in kind of an **accordion form**, preserving the HTML table structure. Table headers in each accordion field are provided in CSS as `::before` element to avoid multiplying content and accessibility issues.
